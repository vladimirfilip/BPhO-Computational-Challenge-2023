By: Constantin Filip, Vladimir Filip

This is a Windows desktop app that is the extension of the 7 tasks implemented for the Computational Challenge.

To view the demo of our Computational Challenge submission, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tV5P1YHzHM) (skip to [1:00](https://youtu.be/9tV5P1YHzHM?t=61) for the demo of this app)

## Try it yourself ##
See the Releases section to install.

## Features ## 

* Support for multiple star systems
    * Star systems currently supported: the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, Tau Ceti, HD 219134

* Highly optimised 2D and 3D animations of the orbits of celestial objects
    * These objects can be from any one of the supported star systems
    * Several parameters are customisable, including centre of orbit, objects to show and the orbit speed

* Real-time spirograph generator.
    * Any two planets from any supported star system supported
    * Orbit speed and number of orbits to be taken into account are customisable
